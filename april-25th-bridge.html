These delicious codfish pastries are often served as a starter, but they are also a fantastic main course when served with rice. One of the reasonscodfish became so popular in Portugal and other Roman Catholic countries was because of the many days when eating meat is forbidden by the Church.

Pastéis de nata were probably first invented before the 18th century by Catholic monks at the Jerónimos Monastery. These pastries were mass produced during medieval times by convents and monasteries with large amounts of leftover egg yolks. The famous Casa Pastéis de Belém began to take over the manufacture of the pastries as more and more convents and monasteries closed in the 1800s.

          This bridge was completed in 1966 and was originally named after the dictator Salazar. The name of the bridge was changed after the revolution of April 25, 1974. The bridge is often compared to the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. 
          Upon completion, the bridge had the longest central span in Europe, and the deepest foundations in the world.
