            <h3>Caldo Verde</h3>
            <p>This is the favorite traditional green soup of the Portuguese. The ingredients are cabbage, onions, thin sliced potatoes, and chouriço</p>

              <p>Not to be confused with the name of the special cookware used to prepare this dish, the cataplana seafood dish is a popular, traditional meal from the Algarve coast.

              <p>One of the original reasons that codfish became so popular in Portugal and other Roman Catholic countries was because of the many days, such s Fridays, Lent, and other festivals, that eating meat is forbidden by the Church.

            <span class="dish_info">
              <img src="static/images/food_images/meat/u-cc-arroz.jpg"></img>
              <p>This traditional meal originated in Braga, a region in northwestern Portugal. Although called "duck rice," this dish is usually made with a combination of different meats, and is generally accompanied by a variety of vegetables, and also seasoned with various herbs and spices.

For example, in northwest Portugal, feijoada is usually made with white beans, whereas in the northeast, it is generally prepared with kidney beans and other vegetables, such s tomatoes, carrots, and cabbage.
