          Eat & Travel is a technology startup that gives diners the immersive experience
         of traveling someplace new. Each month, E&T offers a characteristic meal from a 
         different location, while showing riverboat views to give patrons the sense that 
         they are really visiting the destination by boat.<br><br>
          E&T in London now offers a virtual dinner cruise along the Lisbon coast, with 
          great food and beautiful views.
