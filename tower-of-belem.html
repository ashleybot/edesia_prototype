Pastéis de nata were probably first invented before the 18th century by Catholic monks at the Jerónimos Monastery. These pastries were mass produced during medieval times by convents and monasteries with large amounts of leftover egg yolks. The famous Casa Pastéis de Belém began to take over the manufacture of the pastries as more and more convents and monasteries closed in the 1800s.

            The Tower of Belém was built between 1515 and 1520 as a monument to the Age of Discovery. It is built at the same location from which caravels departed during the height of Portugal's power at sea. 
            <br /><br />
            The architecture of this tower blends Gothic and Moorish elements, including ornate patterns of twisted rope carved from stone.
